### discription: This is my old solution for the task. It uses tree and graph languages. Parses grammer tree to dependency graph. I already understand the concept and most of the format. I could make the verb independent in the tree language, but I did not find the right format for the graph language.
### usage: Use the well known grammer tree of "john loves mary" in the well known format: S(NP(NN(john)),VP(V(loves),NP(NN(mary))))

### discription: This is my new solution for the task. It uses tree and graph languages. Parses grammer tree to dependency graph. I already understand the concept and I'am not far from understanding even the graph format. I made the words perfectly independen, however did not perfect it on the highest levels of the trees.
### usage: Use the well known grammer tree of "john loves mary" in the well known format: S(NP(NN(john)),VP(V(loves),NP(NN(mary))))
